# Gen Garden

Procedurally generate 3D garden scenery

## Development

This project uses [Cyclist](https://github.com/dpisani/cyclist) to coordinate build steps.

To generate all examples in local dev:

```
yarn cyclist start
```

This will start Storybook containing a web viewer for the generated models.
