This module contains stem wrappers that provide arrangements for placing offshoots and stem nodes.

From https://www.brainkart.com/article/Morphology-of-the-Stem_17042/

Stem morphology is simple. Its components are nodes (places where leaves are/were attached) and internodes, long or short (in the last case, plant some-times appears to be stemless, rosette-like).

Stems are different by the type of phyllotaxis. The phyllotaxis refers to the arrangement of leaves. If there is one leaf per node, it is a spiral (alternate) ar-rangement. Two leaves per node means opposite arrangement. Opposite leaves can be all in the same plane or each pair can rotate at 90 . If there are more than two leaves per node, it is awhorled arrangement, and each whorl can also rotate.
